- async test macro that wraps the test like:
let db = PgTempDB::new()
test_fn(db)
await db.async_shutdown()

- .pgpass file instead of just writing password to file? only seems to be an issue for createdb and really at that point we could just execute with psql instead.

- support all builder options in cli (--persist, custom config params)

- cache initial files from initdb or otherwise optimize all setup stuff

- pg extensions?

- unix socket connections

- postgres log stuff (you can set the relevant conf options via the builder though)

- figure out how hard it would be to read the postgres wire protocol and change the database name to a random one so that you can have 1 cluster and each connection connects to a new database, even from the cli
	- obviously this doesn't work if the client code wants to use multiple databases
	- conflicts with --persist
